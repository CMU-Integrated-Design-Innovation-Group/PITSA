# PITSA
A GPU-based Iterative Parallel Classification Method for Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problems

The PITSA project provides the code lists and the Python source code to implement a GPU-based iterative parallel classification method for two continuous constraint satisfaction problems. The results of these two problems are also included in the project. 
The PITSA project is authored by Wangchuan Feng, Guanglu Zhang, and Jonathan Cagan, from Carnegie Mellon University.
